ObjC2RoboVM is a parser that creates RoboVM bindings from CLang AST dumps (not the best idea, but it works surprisingly well)

h3. Example usage

To generate the dumps for the UIKit framework, do (replacing with the correct paths):

@clang -cc1 -triple armv7-apple-ios5.0.0 -ast-dump -fblocks -x objective-c -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.1.sdk/ /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Headers/UIKit.h@

Save the result to a file, and run ObjC2RoboVM:

@ObjC2RoboVM UIKit uikit-dump.txt@

h3. Status

* Currently, bindings are generated as a text dump, no files are created (useful for debugging, very easy to fix)
* No special cases are handled yet (Maps, Arrays, Lists, NSObject...)
* Lots of bugs, I'm sure :)
